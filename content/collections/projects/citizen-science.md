Used alongside routine monitoring by the Environment Agency, the RMI scheme ensures that water quality is checked more widely, and remedial action is taken at the earliest opportunity, it can also act as a deterrent to polluters, knowing the local area is being monitoring. Data from the national programme is open access via the Cartographer website.\_"

Our Chemical Testing will provide training in the use of field kit such as handheld spectrometers, conductivity meters (for road run off), turbidity tubes and dissolved oxygen meters to enable River Rangers to conduct a full suite of water analysis. Using handheld kit enables trained volunteers to provide a rapid response to reported pollution incidents along with undertaking regular sampling at potential “hotspots” identified through OARTs previous work.\_"

This enigmatic species was also the key focus when the predecessors of OART were formed back in 1995. We have been coordinating an annual “Sea Trout Watch” for many years but this has faltered since 2020 and many of those involved have moved on. We want to reinvigorate it, expanding the number of sites and allocating volunteers a section of river to survey and report back on the presence of “redds”, the areas of disturbed gravel where sea trout have spawned. Having such long-term datasets enables us to analyse populations through time and provides an early warning as to any significant decrease in numbers. The results also help us to identify where spawning areas require management/maintenance to ensure there is always habitat available to support the Sea Trout.'
