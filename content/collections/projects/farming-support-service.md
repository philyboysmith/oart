            text: 'To restore our rivers to good health we need to look beyond the river itself and work across the surrounding landscape. Our approach to this is to collaborate with farmers and landowners to co-create the most appropriate and viable enhancements possible, from small scale interventions to large scale wetlands, the control of Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS), re-wiggling river channels, and establishing functional buffer strips. We do not believe that it is a choice between healthy environments or food production, but that sensitive and considered landscape enhancements can deliver both.'

            text: 'We are committed to finding solutions to the climate and ecological crises affecting our water environments in a way which works for those who own and/or manage the land for agriculture. Our experience has shown that these two critical components of our landscape (farming and functional habitats) should not be considered as separate entities but as one ambition to have a thriving agricultural sector alongside high quality, and clean, rivers and wetlands.
