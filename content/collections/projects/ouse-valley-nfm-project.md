            text: 'For the Bevern Stream and Longford Stream our focus is on a range of natural flood management interventions, from slowing the flow with ditch blocking and leaky dams to temporarily retaining water through floodplain connectivity and habitat such as scrapes. River restoration has a key role in reducing flood risk. Re-naturalising and re-wiggling our straightened and over-deep watercourses are two ways in which we can help downstream communities. Tree planting and hedgerow creation form part of our programme of works and increase connectivity, provide river shade and improve our rates of carbon sequestration alongside reducing the impact of flooding.'
