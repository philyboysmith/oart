            text: 'Climate change is a major threat to the health of our waterways, increasing the risk of droughts alongside high intensity storms which will impact both rural and urban populations. Only through increasing our knowledge of catchment hydrology can we begin to implement solutions which consider not just the present but future resilience for the next generation. Through our work on floods, drought and climate we are looking ahead to ensure the right interventions, in the right place, enabling an adaptive pathway approach to our catchments long term health.'

            text: 'We will build resilience into rivers and streams enabling them to adapt against periods of low flow, focusing on increased permeability, reduced abstraction, water sustainable agriculture and, nature-based, on-farm storage. Alongside this we are working strategically to provide natural flood management (NFM) solutions at scale, based on data and evidence to identify the most appropriate locations for installation. Within urban environments we will create a network of water focused nature-based solutions enabling urban nature recovery and working with households, schools and public bodies to implement community wide approaches to reducing runoff from hard standing areas.'
