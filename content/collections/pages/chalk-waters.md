            text: "From the Ferring Rife in the west to Newhaven in the east, the coastal plains of Sussex are rich with waters flowing from the South Downs, forming rare chalk water habitats. Some are perennial, such as the Cockshut Stream on the edge of Lewes Brooks, and some are ephemeral, like the Lewes Winterbourne, Broadwater Brook and the “Sewers” of Newhaven.\_"

From site specific enhancements, such as habitat restoration and the removal of invasive species to whole waterbody improvements in water quality, hydrology and connectivity within the landscape, we are actively seeking to improve and protect not just the watercourses themselves but their associated habitats and sources.'

            text: "In 2010, freshwater ecologist and river restoration expert, Dr Nigel Holmes surveyed the headstreams of many of our sub-catchments. The results of these surveys verified over 25 sections of true chalk stream to the north of the South Downs overlooked in national strategies and databases but are just as important as iconic chalk streams such as the Test and Itchen. Unfortunately, Nigel passed away in 2014 and OART is committed to picking up the recommendations within the Sussex Chalk Stream report to ensure these valuable areas are protected, enhanced and highlighted for their importance in our landscape.\_\_"

            text: 'Groundwater is a fundamental ecosystem service provided by the catchment, which is comprised of two major aquifers. Of these The Brighton Chalk Block provides public water supplies for Brighton and Hove and beyond to some 365,000 people, as well as base flow to streams, rivers and the marine environment. Its status is at risk from rising nitrate levels, as well as risks associated with turbidity and contaminants such as pesticides, chlorides, oils and solvents and diffuse pollution in both urban and rural areas.'
