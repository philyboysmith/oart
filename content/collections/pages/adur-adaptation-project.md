            text: 'We’re delighted to announce the launch of the Adur Adaptation Project, a ten-year innovative initiative aimed at enhancing flood resilience and biodiversity within the River Adur Catchment. This project is a collaborative effort between OART and the Environment Agency, building on three years of extensive data analysis alongside work with landowners, farmers, and local communities to identify and address flooding and ‘wet-spots’ across the catchment area.'

            text: 'The Adur Adaptation Project seeks to mitigate flood risks to vulnerable properties through Natural Flood Management (NFM) techniques, which leverage natural processes to slow and store water more effectively. These techniques not only reduce the impact of flooding but also bring numerous environmental benefits, including improved biodiversity, better water quality, reduced pollution, increased carbon capture, and enhanced floodplain connectivity.'

Parish Councils, Local Action Groups, Landowners and community members are all being invited to get involved in the project, whether through imparting knowledge, altering land use or management, or volunteering to help deliver interventions."
