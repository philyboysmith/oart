            text: 'We will expand our monitoring across the whole catchment, incorporating Citizen Science to highlight areas for more in-depth analysis at our testing laboratory. We will advocate the use of nature-based solutions as the preferred solution to water quality issues, whilst seeking to integrate these alongside hard-engineering where necessary. We aim to improve water quality parameters of phosphate, dissolved oxygen and nitrate across 10% of our monitoring area by 2030. (Maybe Link This to the DATA PAGE??)'
