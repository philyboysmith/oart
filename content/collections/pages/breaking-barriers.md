            text: 'The Adur & Ouse Catchment contains over 400 man-made structures creating multiple problems for our rivers ecology, preventing the movement of fish, blocking access for eels, and disrupting the natural movement of sediment, preventing flow and increasing the impact of drought. Whilst some of these structures serve a function in flood risk management and flow monitoring, many are a now redundant legacy of historic navigations, agricultural practices, or land drainage.'
