            text: 'Donations lie at the heart of maintaining the Trust and drive a wide range of projects and activities that ultimately enhance and protect river habitats for both wildlife and people. Each donation, whether it’s a one-off gift or regular support, directly contributes to the improvement of our rivers and streams and their associated ecosystems. Be a catalyst for transformation – with just £10, we can plant a tree, with £25, we can carry out comprehensive water quality testing, and with £75, we can create 5m of spawning grounds for our beloved gravel loving fish.'
