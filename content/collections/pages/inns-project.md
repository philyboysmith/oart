            text: 'Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) are plants or animals which have established and spread outside their natural range and are one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity. They usually arrive free from the selection pressures of their natural enemies and therefore have the potential to establish and spread rapidly, with traits such as high reproductive capacity and dispersal capability further increasing their invasion potential.'
