  The construction of 20 houses under approved planning application LW/18/0472
  will begin  this summer 2025. The site is a field off Riddens Lane Plumpton Green and the field is bounded on one side by  the Bevern Stream. I have just learnt that the drainage for the site including the roads and access road will  be piped into the Bevern Stream. How will the damage we are doing to the environment eg micro plastic be curtailed if do not stop certain pollution when we have an opportunity to do so at the outset. Lewes Planning appear to have no interest in the health of  our streams,a reflection of central Goverment. Can you help?
