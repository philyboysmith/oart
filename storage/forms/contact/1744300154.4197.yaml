message_body: 'Peter King has said that he will do a guided walk at the Cockshut Project for Seaford Natural History Society on Tuesday 22nd April at 10 a.m.  I sent a reminder to him on peter.king@oart.org.uk on 8th April but have had no acknowledgement.  If this has not reached him for any reason please remind him of our walk and ask him to confirm that he is still able to lead it.  Thank you'
