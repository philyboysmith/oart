  Greetings,
  My name is Eleanor Trevillion, I am a recent graduate from the University of Nottingham, and I am writing to inquire as to whether you have any job positions that you think I would be suitable for. Important to note: I am currently on a gap year doing some travelling, so will not be available until May this year. 
  It's no problem if there aren't any, I just thought I'd check because I'm keen to work with an organisation such as Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust.
  Kind Regards,
  Eleanor.
  (I can send a CV and/or cover letter upon request)
