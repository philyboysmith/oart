  Good morning, I work for Laughton Greenwood Benefit Society. We have a spring and winterbourne stream that runs into a pond before heading out under A22 heading towards Chiddingly. We are in discussion on whether we need to desilt this pond. Is it possible for guidance or advice on this?
  Kind regards
