  Cheyney Field, Ringmer flood management.
  Good morning, I own the house Hews Cottage in the north east corner of your wetland in Cheyney Field. Between our properties I have a wooden six foot panelled fence. On the Cheyney side is a large amount of brambles which over time has grown up and over my fence to such an extent it has pushed the fence out of its footings. Early last year your tree woodsmen tidied the trees surrounding the pond and I took the opportunity to ask them whether they would clear the brambles in order for me to replace the fence. They advised me that it was not in their contract but they would notify you of my request. As the weather is now improving I am wondering whether you can assist in my endeavours to tidy up this part of the wetland?
  Yours sincerely
