  Hello, rather embarrassingly I realised that I have not actually become a member of OART. I just tried to sign up agreeing to £50 per year only to find at payment stage it said £50 per MONTH. I'm sure this is a glitch but I didn't want to proceed as £50 a month is a lot more than I can afford. Can you let me know what I should do next.

  Many thanks
  Ali
