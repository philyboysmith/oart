  Dear OART,


  I hope this finds you very well.


  My name is Sarah Stirk and I am a London based multimedia artist, investigator and Creative Director at Wildlight, a women led cooperative exposing environmental, human rights and animal welfare issues.

  I am writing to you today about my new project, Waterborne. It is the second in a series of four projects looking at pollution in the UK and its environmental impact on the land, wildlife and people.

  The first project of the series is Airborne, looking at air pollution in London and its impact on children in the city, linking to wider questions about climate change. 


  My focus is now looking at the state of water in the UK, more specifically in London and the south east heading down to the Sussex coast. The idea is to continue to utilize making the scientific data visible through artwork that can reach new audiences and generate more exposure surrounding the issue.


  I've been in touch with Ellen Rotheray at Sussex University and she suggested that I get in touch with you. 


  I was wondering if you would be willing to have a chat about the amazing work you're doing? 


  Many thanks and I look forward to hearing from you,


  All the best,


  Sarah
