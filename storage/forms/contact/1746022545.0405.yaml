  Hello

  Hope this finds you well!

  I am a mature student at Plumpton college studying conservation level 3 and am looking for volunteering oppurtunities to further build upon the knowledge I've gained on my course and also to ideally form part of my work experience hours.

  I am seeking some volunteering around aquatic environments as I really enjoyed the river fisheries creation unit this year and would like to do more work with river habitats. I currently live in Newhaven so if you have any volunteering oppurtunities with the river Ouse that would be ideal.

  Please let me know if you would require any more information and I look forward to your reply.

  Many Thanks

  Matt
