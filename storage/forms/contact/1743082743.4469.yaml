  An acquaintance recently got in contact with me regarding a colourful, frothy discharge into the Adur from the Horton tip site in Small Dole (grid ref TQ20111243).  I've been in touch with the EA to get details of the discharge permit (EPR/BV9900IS, which seems markedly lax at that location) and have asked for the last year's worth of quarterly monitoring reports.
  However a colleague suggested that OART might already have a file on those discharge points (the second at TQ20591228 is much more proscriptive).  
  Do you have an info that can be shared, please?
  Thanks.
