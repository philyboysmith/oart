  Good Morning, 
  We are contacting you hoping for some advice please.
  We live at Bevernbridge and are aware of some fish that have become stranded in a gulley on the Old Hamsey Lakes site.
  I am contacting you on behalf of the Old Hamsey Lakes Residents group. 
  Might you give some advice about what could be done about the situation please. Photos of the location and fish involved are available. 
  In case you need it my mobile is 079 5000 1992.  Best Regards Martin Blackmore.
